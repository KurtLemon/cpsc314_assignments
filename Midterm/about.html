                    I am a Computer Science student at Gonzaga University expected to graduate in May 2019. I have
                    studied abroad in Auckland, New Zealand to further study computer science. CS has been a major part
                    of my life since senior year of high school when I first was introduced to Java programming in an AP
                    CS class. Since then I have dabbled in hardware programming and design, mobile app development,
                    machine learning, and database services. I am extremely eager to learn any facet of computer science
                    development and have experimented in multiple fields because of it.

                    Besides computer science I am interested in biology and mathematics, enough so to get a minor in
                    math and to fill some of my core science with biology. Health and human physiology are both major
                    interests of mine and so I eventually hope to work as a CS developer in those fields.

                    Besides CS, I like to fill my free time with cycling, rock climbing, and running. I like to fill my
                    free time with athletics because spending time in the outdoors is a welcomed change from the
                    computer desk and because all my sports are rewarding and exhilarating in their own light. Since
                    health is very important to me I also very much enjoy cooking and eating vegan food when I can find
                    the time between classes.
