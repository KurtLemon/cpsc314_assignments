                The new state course removed any of the wooden features that were present on the original 16 mile trail
                and replaced the skinny singletrack with a machine cut ~4' wide track down the mountain. This route is
                worth riding MANY times. For those that want to get tricksy, there are jumps littered throughout the
                trail as well. This trail is known for its flow. This trail is now a designated one way from the Lee's
                Train/C$ intersection. Counterclockwise the descent is shorter but steeper in spots. One of the best
                downhills in the area.

                Sight lines are fantastic and the flow is amazing. Formerly smooth as glass, it has taken on a very
                natural character with lots of rollers to soak up or jump. Technically you can go both directions but
                everyone typically starts from Guardsman and either drops down Desolation or continues to Mill Canyon or
                Ridgeline Connector. This trail is the cherry on top when riding Porcupine rim! Pretty dry and fast.
                Chewed up, lots of braking bumps, but still fun. More branches down and seems they are often in bad
                spots, i.e. landings.

                Rose meadows and finishing with this trail. Amazing views of Castle valley are afforded after 50 meters
                of riding. Better yet, don't do it unless other people are pretty confident in your fitness. Rowdy
                little downhill/freeride track. High elevation trails are clear May-October, bring plenty of water.
                Removable by hand saw. The exposed rock section near the bottom is a highlight of the trail giving the
                exposed granite slabs of Squamish a run for their money.

                Do not ride when wet and not if you are not a skilled rider. This trail can be sandy during dry summer
                months and is best after rain, in the spring or fall. So be careful with your carbon frames! Check
                yourself before you wreck yourself. It can be accessed from the base at Old Fort Picnic Grounds or the
                base of the upper climb. Use some caution in the corners here. On the bike map it is often combined as
                the Whole Enchilada with Porcupine Rim, Kokopelli, Hazard County and Burro Pass.
