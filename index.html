		<p>Wow! What a splended header! Makes you really appreciate how far we've come 
		technologically since before HTML5. Historically, web developers have a very hard
		choice to make when designing their websites. What is this decision you may ask.
		Well, let me explain it for you. Before I begin, I'd just like to apologize for 
		for how long winded this answer is. When creating demo text, it is beneficial to 
		visualize your website with a significant amount of text on screen because how 
		would you be able to tell I could make a website if the demo-site only looked 
		like:</p>
		<p>sample text.</p>
		<p>See, that would look absolutely autrocious. Now that the actual demo has 
		multiple paragraphs it is looking quite a lot more professional. Now that I have 
		sufficiently explained my position on demo text, I'll get to this well fabled 
		conundrum that web developers face: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Do you tell your clients to piss off and use Weebly?</li>
			<li>Or do you put up with writing another gosh darn CSS file?</li>
		</ol>

			 alt="Look at this thing I drew" 
			 height="80" 
			 width="80">
		<p><em>Look at this, when it's tiny it doesn't look too bad.<em></p>
		<img src="Season_21_Ep01.png" 
			 alt="Look at this thing I drew but larger this time" 
			 height="400" 
			 width="400">
		<p><em>But when it's bigger you can tell that it was made with 
		<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027344/windows-10-get-microsoft-paint">
		Microsoft Paint<a>.</em><p>

		<p>Wow, I really hope you're checking our homework on Chrome because that's 100% NOT 
		a chicken emoji on Firefox.</p>
